## Efficient Organizing
Receive 5 :badge.

## Reconsideration
Replace 1 :red_x with 2 :purple_or_yellow_cube or 1 :green_check with 2 :red_cube.

## Opposition Research
Your opponent must lose half (rounded up) of their :badge.

## Change In Plans
Look at your opponent’s hand. Your opponent must discard 1 card of your choice that does not have a :yellow_campaigner / :purple_campaigner / :red_campaigner on it. Your opponent then draws 1 replacement card from their Draw Deck.

## Bellwether State
Select one state and remove any :red_cube and add 4 :purple_or_yellow_cube or remove any :purple_or_yellow_cube and add 4 :red_cube.

## Superior Lobbying
Roll 4 :d8. For each 6, 7 or 8 rolled, add 1 :congressional_marker to Congress or remove 1 :congressional_marker from Congress.

## The Winning Plan
Draw 6 cards from your Draw Deck. Play 1 card for its event immediately. Place any number of the remaining 5 cards on the top of your Draw Deck and the rest at the bottom of your Draw Deck.

## Regional Focus
Add 1 :purple_or_yellow_cube or 1 :red_cube per state in any one region.

## Eye on the Future
Playable if it is Turn 5 or Turn 6. Look through your Draw Deck and select 1 card and play for its event immediately. Then reshuffle your Draw Deck.

## Transportation
Move all of your :purple_campaigner and :yellow_campaigner OR :red_campaigner to any region(s) without playing any :badge and then take a Campaigning action.

## Counter Strat
Remove one card that is “in effect for the remainder of the turn” and place it in the appropriate discard pile.

## National Focus
Add 2 :purple_or_yellow_cube or 2 :red_cube in one state of each region.

<h2>RULES OF THE GAME</h2>

<p style="margin:12px 36px">
<i>
"The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or 
abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex. Congress 
shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation."
</i>

<p style="margin:12px 36px;text-align:right">
– Nineteenth Amendment to the US Constitution

<h2>
OVERVIEW
</h2>

<p>
Votes for Women is an asymmetrical, two-sided game that revolves around the battle to ratify or reject 
the Nineteenth Amendment to the US Constitution. The <b>Suffragist side</b> will push Congress to propose the 
Nineteenth Amendment, and campaign to have 36 states ratify the Amendment. The <b>Opposition side</b>
will try to prevent Congress from proposing the amendment or, failing that, to have 13 states reject 
the amendment. 

<p>
Players will add or remove Congressional markers as support for the amendment waxes and wanes in 
Congress, while also placing Purple <img class="icon" src="../images/icon_purple_cube.png">
/Yellow <img class="icon" src="../images/icon_yellow_cube.png">
 cubes (Suffragist side) or Red cubes <img class="icon" src="../images/icon_opposition_cube.png">
 (Opposition side) 
to reflect their political power in individual states. When a player gains support in a state, they first reduce 
or eliminate their opponent's cubes, as needed, before adding their own cubes so that a state will only ever 
have Purple <img class="icon" src="../images/icon_purple_cube.png">
/Yellow <img class="icon" src="../images/icon_yellow_cube.png">
 or Red <img class="icon" src="../images/icon_opposition_cube.png">.

<p>
Once the Nineteenth Amendment has been sent to the states for ratification (or rejection), the Suffragist 
side will place a Green check <img class="icon" src="../images/icon_green_check.png">
 in each state that ratifies the amendment and the Opposition side will place 
a Red X <img class="icon" src="../images/icon_red_x.png">
 in each state that rejects the amendment. 

<h2>
VICTORY CONDITIONS
</h2>

<p>
If the Nineteenth Amendment has not been sent to the states for ratification by the end of Turn 6, 
the Opposition side immediately wins the game.

<p>
If the Nineteenth Amendment has been sent to the states:

<ul>

<li>
As soon as the 36th state <i>ratifies</i> the amendment, the Suffragist side immediately wins the game.

<li>
As soon as the 13th state <i>rejects</i> the amendment, the Opposition side immediately wins the game.

</ul>

<h3>
HISTORICAL DOCUMENTS
</h3>

<p>
Because of the importance of the history 
of the campaign to pass the Nineteenth Amendment, we have included a <i>Historical 
Supplement & Designer's Notes</i> booklet; a composite of all of the suffrage-related 
stories from the August 19, 1920 issue of The New York Times; and several historical 
documents that are described in the supplement.

<h2>
THE BOARD
</h2>

<p>
The map of the United States is divided into six regions of eight states each: 

<p>
<b>West</b> (1); <b>Plains</b> (2); <b>South</b> (3); <b>Midwest</b> (4); <b>Atlantic & Appalachia</b> (5); <b>Northeast</b> (6).  
Each region has a <b>Region Bubble</b> (7)  where Campaigners are placed when in the region.

<p>
Players will place a Purple cube <img class="icon" src="../images/icon_purple_cube.png">, Yellow cube <img class="icon" src="../images/icon_yellow_cube.png">
 or Red cube <img class="icon" src="../images/icon_opposition_cube.png">
 in a state to show their political power 
– and later, place a Green check <img class="icon" src="../images/icon_green_check.png">
 or Red X <img class="icon" src="../images/icon_red_x.png">
 in a state to show whether or not a state has ratified or 
rejected the Nineteenth Amendment.

<p>
Certain card events are <b>Persistent Events</b>.
Cards with a <b>rest of turn</b> icon <img class="icon" src="../images/icon_rest_of_turn.png">
 are placed in the "Cards in 
Effect for the Rest of the Turn" box. Cards with a <b>rest of game</b> icon <img class="icon" src="../images/icon_rest_of_game.png">
 are placed in the "Cards in Effect 
for the Rest of the Game" box. Cards with a <b>ballot box</b> icon <img class="icon" src="../images/icon_ballot_box.png">
 are placed in the "Cards in Effect for 

Final Voting" box (8) (9) (10).

<p>
The <b>Congressional Track</b> (11)  shows the level of support in Congress for women's suffrage. Players will add or 
remove <b>Congressional markers</b> <img class="icon" src="../images/icon_congressional_marker.png">
 to show the ebb and flow of support for the Nineteenth Amendment. 
The <b>Turn Track</b> (12)  uses the <b>Turn marker</b> <img class="icon" src="../images/icon_turn_marker.png">
 to indicate what turn it is.

<img class="big" src="the_board.jpg">

<h2>
THE PIECES, DICE AND BUTTONS
</h2>

<p>
There are:

<ul>

<li>
Two standard Campaigners in each color: 
Purple (Suffragist) (1), Yellow (Suffragist) (2)
and Red (Opposition) (3), as well as two 
alternate design Campaigners in each 
color (4)  (5)  (6).  
Only two Campaigners of each color will be  
used during the game.

<li>
65 Purple cubes (7), 65 Yellow cubes (8)  and 
60 Red cubes (9). Cubes are used to represent 
the political power of each side. The Suffragist 
side uses both Purple and Yellow (to represent 
the diversity of organizations and movements 
that worked for women's suffrage) while the 
Opposition uses Red.

<li>
36 Green checks (10)  and 13 Red X's (11)  
to signify if a state has ratified or rejected 
the Nineteenth Amendment. 

<li>
Six Congressional markers (12)  to indicate the 
level of support for the Nineteenth Amendment 
in Congress. 

<li>
One Turn marker (13).

<li>
Six blue dice (14)  with numbers 1-4, four red 
dice (15)  with numbers 1-6, four white dice (16)  
 with numbers 1-8. Also, two gray dice (17)  
and three black dice (18)  used in Solitaire and 
Cooperative play.

<li>
Twelve Suffragist buttons of four designs 
(19)  (20) (21)  (22), and six Opposition buttons of 
two designs (23)  (24). These buttons represent the 
organizational strength of each side and are 
used to re-roll unsatisfactory die rolls, to move 
a Campaigner to a different Region, to bid on 
Strategy Cards and to spend as directed by 
certain Event cards.

</ul>

<p>
<i>
The game comes with extra pieces in case any are lost or 
damaged. We recommend that you set them to the side.

<h2>
THE CARDS
</h2>

<p>
There are five decks of cards: 

<ul>

<li>
Suffragist Event deck (52 cards)

<li>
Opposition Event deck (52 cards)

<li>
Oppobot Event deck (42 cards)

<li>
Strategy deck (12 cards)

<li>
State deck (12 cards)

</ul>

<h3>
EVENT CARDS
</h3>

<p style="text-align:center">
<img src="page5_card1.jpg">
<br>
<i>Suffragist card</i>

<p style="text-align:center">
<img src="page5_card2.jpg">
<br>
<i>Opposition card</i>

<p>
Each Event card includes Card Title (1), Card Era (2), 
Event text (3), Historical text (4), Persistent Event 
icon (5).

<p>
Each card has a <b>Card Era</b> that is used to create 
each players' <b>Draw Deck</b>. Late cards will be on 
the bottom of the deck, <b>Middle</b> cards will be in 
the middle of the deck and <b>Early</b> cards will be on 
the top of the deck. The Suffragist and Opposition 
decks each have one <b>Start card</b> – this card will be in 
the player's hand at the start of the game.

<p>
Some Event cards have a prerequisite – for 
example, Fifteenth Amendment can only be 
played if The Civil War is not in effect. A card 
is in effect if it is in the appropriate Persistent 
Event box.

<p>
Some Event cards require a player to roll a <img class="icon" src="../images/icon_d6.png">
 and 

only take the action on a roll of 3-6. Otherwise, the 
Event card is discarded with no effect – even if it has 
a Persistent Event icon on it. A player may spend a <img class="icon" src="../images/icon_button.png">
to re-roll a <img class="icon" src="../images/icon_d6.png">
 and may continue to re-roll as long as 
they have a <img class="icon" src="../images/icon_button.png">
 to spend.

<p>
Some Event cards are Persistent Events and are 
marked with special icons
<img class="icon" src="../images/icon_rest_of_turn.png">
<img class="icon" src="../images/icon_rest_of_game.png">
<img class="icon" src="../images/icon_ballot_box.png">
If played as 
an Event, these cards are placed on the board in the 
appropriate Persistent Event space. 

<p>
<i>
Each space indicates the Persistent Event's effect.
</i>

<p>
There are two Event card icons that require 
specific explanation:

<ul>

<li> <img class="icon" src="../images/icon_button.png">
 represents buttons. The Suffragist 
player will receive or spend Suffragist <img class="icon" src="../images/icon_button.png">
and the Opposition player will do the same 
in Opposition <img class="icon" src="../images/icon_button.png">.

<li> <img class="icon" src="../images/icon_purple_or_yellow_cube.png">
 allows the Suffragist player to place Purple 
and/or Yellow cubes. For example, if the 
Suffragist player is placing two cubes, they can 
place two Purple cubes, or two Yellow cubes, 
or one Purple and one Yellow cube.

</ul>

<h3>
STATE & STRATEGY CARDS
</h3>

<p style="text-align:center">
<img src="page5_card3.jpg">
<br>
<i>State card</i>

<p style="text-align:center">
<img src="page5_card4.jpg">
<br>
<i>Strategy card</i>

<p>
On each State and Strategy card is Card Title (1), 
Event text (2), Oppobot alternate text (3). Strategy 
cards also include Historical text (4). The State cards 
are color-coded to the region that they are located.

<p>
State cards can be claimed when a side has four 
cubes in that state, while Strategy cards are claimed 
either during the Strategy Phase or via Event 
card play.

<h2>
SETUP
</h2>

<p>
This is the setup for the <b>two-player Competitive</b> game.

<ul>

<li>
<i>
Set aside the Oppobot deck and the gray and black dice, as they will not be used in the Competitive game.
</i>

<li>
Place each player's cubes, Campaigners and markers on their side of the board (left: Suffragist /  

right: Opposition). Be sure to have exactly two Purple Campaigners (1), two Yellow campaigners (2), 
two Red campaigners (3), six Congressional markers (4), 36)Green checks (5) and 13 Red Xs (6).

<li>
Shuffle the State deck and then set aside the top three cards (they will not be used this game).  

Place, face up, the remaining nine cards (7) in two rows along the bottom of the board.

<li>
Shuffle the Strategy deck and then draw three cards and place them to the right of the State cards (8). 

Keep the rest of the Strategy deck nearby.

<li>
Each player creates their Draw deck (9) as follows: Separate the event cards by their Era – Start, Early, 

Middle, Late. Shuffle the Late cards and place them face down. Then, shuffle the Middle cards and 
place them face down on top of the Late cards. Then, shuffle the Early cards and place them face down 
on top of the Late and Middle cards. Each player takes their Start card into their hand (10).

<li>
Place the Suffragist buttons (11) and Opposition buttons (12) at the top of the board.

<li>
Place the Turn marker (13) on Turn 1 on the Turn Track. Keep the blue d4, red d6, and white d8 nearby (14).

</ul>

<p>
<img src="setup.jpg">

<h2>
SEQUENCE OF PLAY
</h2>

<p>
The game consists of six turns. If neither player has 
won after six turns, the game goes into Final Voting. 
Each turn shares the following sequence of play:

<p>
<b>1. Planning Phase</b>

<p>
<b>2. Strategy Phase </b>

<p>
<b>3. Operations Phase</b>

<p>
<b>4. Cleanup Phase</b>

<h3>
PLANNING PHASE
</h3>

<p>
Each player draws six cards from their Draw 
deck. When added to either their Start card (on 
Turn 1) or their card held from the previous turn 
(on Turns 2-6), their hand should begin with 
seven cards.

<h3>
STRATEGY PHASE
</h3>

<p>
<i>
Please note that the Strategy Phase  
is skipped on Turn 1.
</i>

<ol>
<li>
After looking at the available Strategy Cards, 
the Suffragist player announces how many <img class="icon" src="../images/icon_button.png">
 

they will commit to the Strategy Phase. The 
Suffragist player may commit zero <img class="icon" src="../images/icon_button.png">. 

<li>
The Opposition player may then defer, match or 
supersede the Suffragist player's commitment.

<ol type="a">
<li>
If the Opposition player defers, then the 
Suffragist player spends their committed <img class="icon" src="../images/icon_button.png">
and selects a Strategy card.

<li>
If the Opposition player matches, then both 
players spend that number of <img class="icon" src="../images/icon_button.png">
 and neither 
player selects a Strategy card.

<li>
If the Opposition player supersedes, both 
players spend their <img class="icon" src="../images/icon_button.png">
 – the Opposition player 
spends one more <img class="icon" src="../images/icon_button.png">
 than the Suffragist player's 
commitment – and the Opposition player 
selects a Strategy card.

</ol>

<li>
If a Strategy card is selected by a player, that 
player places the card, face up, in front of them 
and another Strategy card is placed along the 
bottom of the board so there are three Strategy 
cards available for future turns.

</ol>

<h3>
OPERATIONS PHASE
</h3>

<p>
There are six rounds in the Operations Phase. In 
each round, first the Suffragist player and then the 
Opposition player must play one card from their 
hand and may play one claimed Strategy or State 
card from in front of them.

<p>
When playing a card from their hand, a player has 
four options:

<ol>

<li> Play a card as an <b>Event</b>

<li> Play a card for a <b>Campaigning Action</b>

<li> Play a card for an <b>Organizing Action</b>

<li> Play a card for a <b>Lobbying Action</b>

</ol>

<h4>
Play a Card as an Event
</h4>

<p>
When a card is played as an Event, its event text 
is read and resolved. Some Event cards have a 
prerequisite for being played as an Event. If that 
prerequisite is not met, then the card may not 
be played as an Event. Some Event cards require 
a player to spend <img class="icon" src="../images/icon_button.png">
 to play the Event – if the 

player does not have enough <img class="icon" src="../images/icon_button.png">
 to spend, the card 

may not be played as an Event. Some Event cards 
require a successful die roll – if the die roll is a 
failure then the Event card is discarded without 
following the rest of the Event text. However, a 
player may spend a <img class="icon" src="../images/icon_button.png">
 to re-roll a failed die roll.

<p>
After resolving the Event, the card is placed in 
the discard pile – unless the Event is a Persistent 
Event. Persistent Events should be placed in the 
appropriate box on the game board.

<h4>
Play a Card for a Campaigning Action
</h4>

<p>
When a card is played for a Campaigning action, the 
player rolls a <img class="icon" src="../images/icon_d4.png">
 for each Campaigner they have in play 
(on the board). If the player is unsatisfied with the roll, 
they may spend a <img class="icon" src="../images/icon_button.png">
 to re-roll all of the dice rolled. 

<p>
Once satisfied with their roll, the player assigns a 
die to each of their Campaigners. Each Campaigner 
may then place the corresponding number of cubes, 
matching the Campaigner's color, in the states 
within the region that the Campaigner is in. The 
player may spend a <img class="icon" src="../images/icon_button.png">
 to move the Campaigner to 
a different region, but all of the corresponding cubes 
must be put in the same region. Then the card is 
placed in the discard pile.

<p><i>
EXAMPLE: The Suffragist player has a <img class="icon" src="../images/icon_purple_campaigner.png">
 and a  <img class="icon" src="../images/icon_yellow_campaigner.png">

 in the Northeast. The Suffragist player rolls two <img class="icon" src="../images/icon_d4.png">
 

 and rolls 1 and 1. The Suffragist player decides to spend  
a <img class="icon" src="../images/icon_button.png">
 and re-rolls 3 and 4. The Suffragist player assigns  

the 3 to the <img class="icon" src="../images/icon_purple_campaigner.png">
 and assigns the 4 to the <img class="icon" src="../images/icon_yellow_campaigner.png">. The 

Suffragist player decides to place two <img class="icon" src="../images/icon_purple_cube.png">
 in Vermont 

and one <img class="icon" src="../images/icon_purple_cube.png">
 in Connecticut with the <img class="icon" src="../images/icon_purple_campaigner.png">. The Suffragist 

player also decides to spend one <img class="icon" src="../images/icon_button.png">
 to move the <img class="icon" src="../images/icon_yellow_campaigner.png">
 to 

the West region, and places four <img class="icon" src="../images/icon_yellow_cube.png">
 in California.
</i>

<h4>
Play a Card for an Organizing Action
</h4>

<p>
When a card is played for an Organizing action, the 
player takes as many <img class="icon" src="../images/icon_button.png">
 as they have Campaigners 
in play. Then the card is placed in the discard pile.

<h4>
Play a Card for a Lobbying Action
</h4>

<p>
When a card is played for a Lobbying action, the 
player rolls as many <img class="icon" src="../images/icon_d6.png">
 as they have Campaigners 
in play. For each 6 rolled, the player may add one <img class="icon" src="../images/icon_congressional_marker.png">
to Congress or remove one <img class="icon" src="../images/icon_congressional_marker.png">
 from Congress. Then 

the card is placed in the discard pile.

<h4>
Play a claimed State or Strategy Card 
</h4>

<p>
When playing a claimed State or Strategy card, the 
player may play the claimed card before or after 
playing a card from their hand. The text on the 
card is read and resolved, similar to a card played 
as an Event. After play, the card is removed from 
the game. A player may only play one State or 
one Strategy card per round.

<h3>
CLEANUP PHASE
</h3>

<p>
After the six rounds of the Operations Phase is 
the Cleanup Phase. 

<p>
At the end of Turns 1-5, any cards in the "Cards 
in Effect for the Rest of the Turn box" are placed 
in the appropriate discard pile. Each player should 
have one card in their hand to carry over to the next 
Turn. The Turn marker <img class="icon" src="../images/icon_turn_marker.png">
 is advanced and the 
next Turn begins.

<p>
At the end of Turn 6, if the Nineteenth 
Amendment has not been sent to the states for 
ratification, the game ends in an <b>Opposition victory</b>. 
If the Nineteenth Amendment has been sent to the 
states for ratification but neither player has won 
the necessary number of states for victory, the game 
advances to Final Voting. Any cards in the "Cards 
in Effect for the Rest of the Turn box" and "Cards in 
Effect for the Rest of the Game box" are placed in 
the appropriate discard pile.

<blockquote>

<h3>
ORGANIZATIONAL BUTTONS
</h3>

<p>
<img class="icon" src="../images/icon_button.png">
 are a sort of currency in the game that represent 

organizational strength. 
 may be spent in the 

following ways:

<ol>

<li>
A 
<img class="icon" src="../images/icon_button.png">
 may be spent to re-roll a die roll. If 
multiple dice were rolled, all of the dice must 
be re-rolled. A player may continue to spend 
<img class="icon" src="../images/icon_button.png">
to re-roll the same roll until their supply of 
<img class="icon" src="../images/icon_button.png">
 is exhausted. A player may only spend a 
<img class="icon" src="../images/icon_button.png">
to re-roll their roll, never their opponent's roll.

<li>
A 
<img class="icon" src="../images/icon_button.png">
 may be spent to move a Campaigner 
from one region to another region while a player 
is taking a Campaigning action. A separate 
<img class="icon" src="../images/icon_button.png">
must be spent for each Campaigner moved.

<li>
<img class="icon" src="../images/icon_button.png">
 are committed during the Strategy Phase 

and spent as directed by the outcome of 
that Phase.

<li>
<img class="icon" src="../images/icon_button.png">
 may be spent as directed by Event card text.

</ol>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>

<h3>
SENDING THE NINETEENTH AMENDMENT TO THE STATES
</h3>

<p>
When the sixth 
<img class="icon" src="../images/icon_congressional_marker.png">
 is placed in Congress, Congress 
has passed the Nineteenth Amendment and sends it 
to the states to be ratified or rejected. Remove all of 
the 
<img class="icon" src="../images/icon_congressional_marker.png">
 from Congress – the Congressional portion 
of the game is complete.

<p>
For each state that has at least four 
<img class="icon" src="../images/icon_purple_or_yellow_cube.png">, remove 
the cubes and replace them with a <img class="icon" src="../images/icon_green_check.png">. These states 
have ratified the Nineteenth Amendment. For each 
state that has at least four <img class="icon" src="../images/icon_opposition_cube.png">, remove the cubes and 
replace them with a <img class="icon" src="../images/icon_red_x.png">. These states have rejected 
the Nineteenth Amendment.

<p>
As play continues, each time a state has four <img class="icon" src="../images/icon_purple_or_yellow_cube.png">,
the cubes are immediately removed and replaced 
with a <img class="icon" src="../images/icon_green_check.png">
 and each time a state has four <img class="icon" src="../images/icon_opposition_cube.png">
 the 
cubes are immediately removed and replaced 
with a <img class="icon" src="../images/icon_red_x.png">. This only occurs after the Nineteenth 
Amendment has been sent to the states.

<p>
The moment that the 36th <img class="icon" src="../images/icon_green_check.png">
 is placed, the 
Nineteenth Amendment is ratified by the states and 
the game ends in a Suffragist victory. Alternatively, 
the moment that the 13th <img class="icon" src="../images/icon_red_x.png">
 is placed, the 
Nineteenth Amendment is rejected by the states 
and the game ends in an Opposition victory.

</blockquote>


<blockquote>

<h3>
ADDING OR REMOVING CUBES IN A STATE
</h3>

<p>
Only one side may have cubes in the same state at the 
same time. If a player is directed to add cubes in a state 
that contains opposing cubes, each cube that is to be 
added removes an opposing cube. Once a state is empty 
of cubes, then cubes of their color may be added.

<p>
<i>
EXAMPLE: There is one 
<img class="icon" src="../images/icon_opposition_cube.png">
 in California and the 
Suffragist player is adding two 
<img class="icon" src="../images/icon_purple_or_yellow_cube.png">
 to California. 
The Suffragist player first removes the 
<img class="icon" src="../images/icon_opposition_cube.png">
 and then 
adds either a 
<img class="icon" src="../images/icon_purple_cube.png">
 or a 
<img class="icon" src="../images/icon_yellow_cube.png">.
</i>

<p>
Whenever an Event directs a player to remove 
cubes of a particular color, this effect is limited to 
that particular color and only to what the opposing 
player has on the board. A player will never add 
their own cubes when directed to remove their 
opponent's cubes.

<p>
If a state has already ratified or rejected the Nineteenth 
Amendment – and therefore has a 
<img class="icon" src="../images/icon_green_check.png">
 or

<h3>
CLAIMING STATE AND STRATEGY CARDS
</h3>

<p>
The game begins with nine State cards available. 
When a player places their fourth cube in a state 
with a card, the player claims that State card and 
places it face up in front of them. The player does 
not lose the card if a subsequent play causes them to 
drop below four cubes in the state. New State cards 
are never put out – there are only nine State cards 
available per game.

<p>
The game also begins with three Strategy cards 
available. Strategy cards may be claimed either 
during the Strategy Phase or by play of certain 
Event cards. Any time a Strategy card is claimed, 

a new one is drawn for the Strategy deck so that 
there are always three Strategy cards available.

<p>
Claimed cards are always placed face up in front 
of the player. A player may play one claimed card 
– State or Strategy – in addition to the Event card 
that they must play from their hand during a round 
of the Operations Phase. After a claimed card is 
played, it is removed from the game.

<p>
When the Oppobot claims a State or Strategy card, 
the Oppobot immediately plays that card for the 
Oppobot effect listed on the card.

<h2>
FINAL VOTING
</h2>

<p>
If after six Turns, the Nineteenth Amendment has 
been sent to the states but neither player has won 
the necessary number of states to win the game 
– 36 states for the Suffragist player or 13 states 
for the Opposition player – then the game enters 
Final Voting.

<p>
In Final Voting, the players take turns, starting with 
the Suffragist player, selecting a state to vote on the 
Nineteenth Amendment. Each player rolls a 
<img class="icon" src="../images/icon_d6.png">. 

Either player may spend a 
<img class="icon" src="../images/icon_button.png">
 to re-roll their die. 
If a player has cubes in the state, then the player 
adds that number of cubes to their total roll. 

<p>
Whoever has the higher total wins the state and 
places either a <img class="icon" src="../images/icon_green_check.png">
 or <img class="icon" src="../images/icon_red_x.png">
 in the state. The default is 

that the Opposition player wins all ties. However, if 
the Suffragist player had previously played <i>Miss Febb 
Wins the Last Vote</i>, then the Suffragist player wins 
all ties.

<p>
<i>
EXAMPLE: The Suffragist player has won 35 states 
and the Opposition player has won 12 states. 
Tennessee is the last state to vote and has two 
<img class="icon" src="../images/icon_opposition_cube.png">. 
</i>

<p>
<i>
Both Voter Registration and Miss Febb Wins the 
Last Vote are in the "Cards in Effect for Final 
Voting" so the Suffragist player rolls a 
<img class="icon" src="../images/icon_d8.png">
 and wins 

all ties. Because Voter Suppression was not played, 
the Opposition player rolls a 
<img class="icon" src="../images/icon_d6.png">. The Suffragist player 
has one 
<img class="icon" src="../images/icon_button.png">
 remaining and the Opposition player has 
no 
<img class="icon" src="../images/icon_button.png">
 remaining.
</i>

<p>
<i>
The Suffragist player rolls a 5 and the Opposition player 
rolls a 4. The Opposition player adds 2 to their roll for 
the two 
<img class="icon" src="../images/icon_opposition_cube.png">
 in Tennessee, so the Opposition player has 

a total of 6 and wins the state. But not so fast – the 
Suffragist player spends their last 
<img class="icon" src="../images/icon_button.png">
 and re-rolls a 6! 

Now both players have a total of 6 and the Suffragist 
player wins the state because <i>Miss Febb Wins the 
Last Vote</i> allows the Suffragist player to win ties.

The Suffragist player places their final 
<img class="icon" src="../images/icon_green_check.png">
 – the states 
have ratified the Nineteenth Amendment and the 
Suffragist player has won the game!

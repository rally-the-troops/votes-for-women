<p>
Votes for Women is a card-driven game covering the American women's suffrage
movement from 1848-1920, culminating with the ratification (or rejection) of
the Nineteenth Amendment.

<p>
To win, the Suffragist player must have Congress pass the proposed Amendment
and then have three-fourths of the states (36 of the then 48 states) ratify the
Amendment. The Opposition player wins by either preventing Congress from
passing the proposed Amendment or by having 13 states reject the Amendment.
